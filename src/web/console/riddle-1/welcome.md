Well done. You made it to your first terminal. So we can assume that you already entered some commands in the console. Now you will learn how to use the console.

Each terminal contains different files. It's always a good idea to know whats inside the terminal. For that purpose the console contains the **list** command.

Type **list** to show a list of available files.
