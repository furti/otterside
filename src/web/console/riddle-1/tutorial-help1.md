----------------------------

As you can see all available commands are shown above. Some of them like **list**, **read** or **exit** are always available. The availability of other commands depends on the Terminal you are connected to.

Some commands like the **read** command take arguments. Arguments in square brackets are optional. If you check the read command you can see that it requires the filename as a parameter.

If you need detailed infos about a command and it's arguments you can type **help _command_**.

Lets try this and type **help read**.
