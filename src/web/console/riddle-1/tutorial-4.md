You can see a list of available files above. The 3 characters before each filename define the permissions for the file.
- **r** means that you can read the file.
- **w** means that you can edit the file.
- **e** means that you can execute the file.

If a - is shown instead of the character you are not allowed to do this kind of thing. So if no r is shown you cannot read the file.

Somethimes files are hidden. You will not see them when you use the list command without any additional parameters. To show hidden files you have to type **list all**.
