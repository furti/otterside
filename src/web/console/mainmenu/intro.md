# The Otterside
Hi there. Thanks for playing the Otterside.  

The Otterside is a game where you solve riddles by implementing algorithms or solving other computer or technical related tasks.  

You control a little toy robot called Edit. Edit lived a good life at Johns house. John played a lot with here and Edit liked it very much. But one day everything changed. Edit was connected to the computer to recharge here battery when a malfunction in the USB driver carried here inside the computer. And thats where your journey begins.

## Why "The Otterside"???
There is this one song from a very famous female singer. An there is this one part in the song, where she sends us greetings from the other side. But somehow the other side sounds like otterside. Because Edit used to live in front of the computer but was carried to the other side, the game is called as it is called.
